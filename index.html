<H1>AI researchers offer support efforts to combat COVID19</H1>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have successfully been applied in China, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea in their efforts against COVID19. To help replicate this success in Europe and elsewhere, as of 30 March 2020, 95 AI and related laboratories from <a href="http://claire-ai.org">CLAIRE</a> have volunteered to help apply AI to the pandemic crisis faced by all our societies. We invite new partners to volunteer for this effort, based on the terms of reference below, and public authorities to consider what issues they face we might be able to help them address. Here ou can find our  <a href="https://claire-ai.org/covid19-charter/">task force charter</a> and <a href="https://claire-ai.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CLAIRE-press-release-13.pdf">press release</a>.</p>

<p>Below you can find ways to support this effort, as well as the <a href="/initiatives/">identified initiatives</a> where AI and emerging technologies are contributing to combat COVID19.</p>
