We want to build on existing solutions and technologies to prevent duplications and want to enable a sustainable impact after the hackathon to take projects to the next level and implement them for our daily life and work. This is an initiative under the patronage of the Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs (FDHA) and supported by [CLAIRE](http://claire-ai.org)

One of the goals of supporting this hackathon is to identify projects that can be taken over after the event by CLAIRE in their efforts to support public services with the Covid-19 situation. Submitted projects to #CodeVsCOVID19 are now available in this [link](http://codevscovid19.devpost.com/submissions). If you are interested in any of these projects, contact the COVID19 Taskforce.
