CLAIRE is the largest European network of AI experts. ‘Take the enormous amounts of health data generated in an intensive care unit. Self-learning algorithms can help doctors make the difficult decisions that sometimes need to be made. Which patient can they expect to recover and who will need more care in the future? This can help doctors be more proactive.’

According to Hoos, this doesn’t require complicated computers with lots of computing power, but instead someone who can program quickly and correctly. ‘We want to help where help is needed most. We want to bring together the knowledge of AI experts with people who can apply this knowledge.’ Bringing together knowledge and skills is precisely the goal of CLAIRE.
