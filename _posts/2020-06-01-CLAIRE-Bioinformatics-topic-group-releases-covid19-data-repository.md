The [Bioinformatics T4 Dataset Repository](http://github.com/CLAIRE-COVID-T4/covid-data) assembles the 10 most important datasets for drug repurposing in an accessible way, putting all these data together in an open, online repository. 

The CLAIRE members documented more than 200 000 protein-protein interactions, 15 000 gene-domain associations, 1.1 million disease-gene associations, and 330 000 gene ontology terms. Combined, the Bioinformatics T4 Dataset Repository is a powerful tool to assist in drug discovery.

The Bioinformatics T4 Dataset Repository is open source and accessible to anyone active in the field of bioinformatics. The resource can be used by many kinds of researchers, including computer scientists, computational biologists and bioinformatics scientists, but also cheminformatics scientists, physicians, and pure biologists.

The CLAIRE Bioinformatics T4 Dataset Repository can be retrieved on github:
