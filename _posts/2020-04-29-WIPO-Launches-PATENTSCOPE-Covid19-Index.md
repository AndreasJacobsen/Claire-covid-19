PATENTSCOPE contains over 83 million patent and related documents to enable comprehensive searching of patent information and has features such as multi-lingual search capabilities and an automatic AI-based translation system. The new COVID-19 functionality allows to easily access thousands of documents with potential use to innovators working on COVID-19.

The new system will provide scientists, engineers, policymakers and industry actors with a source of intelligence for improving the detection, prevention, and treatment of diseases such as the novel coronavirus.
