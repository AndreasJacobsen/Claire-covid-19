# Scientists across Europe offer assistance with using Artificial Intelligence to combat COVID-19

In an open letter, [CLAIRE](http://claire-ai.org) (the Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe, claire-ai.org), offers governmental agencies and public institutions support in managing the unfolding COVID-19 crisis in Europe. This effort is coordinated by the [CLAIRE COVID-19 Taskforce](https://covid19.claire-ai.org)


Other countries are using artificial intelligence to help manage the crisis, including China, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea​, says Emanuela Girardi, an advisor to the Italian government and one of the leaders of CLAIRE's COVID-19 taskforce. -​ - We can – and should – learn from that.

The AI community has much to offer, and many AI researchers and practitioners stand ready to help public institutions that are in the front line of coping with the crisis, a​dds Prof. Gianluca Bontempi from the Université Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium), who co-leads CLAIRE's COVID-19 taskforce with Ms Girardi. -- ​Through CLAIRE, we can access and mobilise world-leading expertise across the full spectrum of AI, and we hope that this will make a difference.
