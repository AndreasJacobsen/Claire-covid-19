# IEEE releases a Statement Regarding the Ethical Implementation of Artificial Intelligence Systems (AIS) for Addressing the COVID-19 Pandemic


<p align="center"><a href="http://standards.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-standards/standards/web/documents/other/gieais-covid.pdf"><img src="/assets/images/images_posts/logo_IEEE_SA.jpg"  width="40%"></a></p>

Digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence Systems (AIS) can play an important and beneficial role in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. They can help model infection dynamics and socio-economic impact, monitor physical distancing, identify vaccines and help fight disease spread. However, these same technologies can also increase surveillance of individuals and populations and undermine fundamental human values such as privacy and human agency. As we lean on AIS technology, it is therefore important to carefully navigate the possible tension between basic ethical principles and fundamental rights and values developed in non-crisis times with the need to address major public health and individual safety issues in this crisis. 

By offering pragmatic recommendations inspired from other global organizations and our work on Ethically Aligned Design, while focusing on the unique role of the IEEE, we hope to contribute to the inclusion of environmental sustainability criteria and of the vital interests of humanity and future generations in general when developing and using AIS in response to the unique challenges brought about by COVID-19.
