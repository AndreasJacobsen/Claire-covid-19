The EU Commission recommends steps and measures to develop a common EU approach for the use of mobile applications and mobile data in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Digital tools can play an important role in the gradual lifting of containment measure, when the time will be ripe for that, if they are compliant with EU rules and well coordinated. [The Recommendation sets out a process towards the adoption with the Member States of a toolbox, focusing on two dimensions](http://ec.europa.eu/info/files/recommendation-apps-contact-tracing_en):

* a pan-European coordinated approach for the use of mobile applications for empowering citizens to take effective and more targeted social distancing measures and for warning, preventing and contact tracing; and
* a common approach for modelling and predicting the evolution of the virus through anonymised and aggregated mobile location data.
