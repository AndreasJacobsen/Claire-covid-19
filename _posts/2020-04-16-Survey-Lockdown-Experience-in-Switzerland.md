# Swiss researchers make a survey on the living conditions and wellbeing during the lockdown experience


Claire network member Idiap is collaborating with EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) and UNIL (University of Lausanne) to sudy lockdown conditions in Switzerland. Our multidisciplinary group of researchers (anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, engineers) is concerned about the living conditions and well-being of the Swiss population during the lockdown period due to the Covid19 pandemic. We are therefore sharing this questionnaire to better understand individual experiences in relation to the current constraints. We also refer to existing support structures, links and numbers as you go through the survey. This survey is part of a collaborative investigation on housing conditions and wellbeing in times of COVID-19 confinement. **It will contribute to the creation of a Swiss Corona Citizen Science Research Team.**

**This research is coordinated by :** 
Garance Clément, Laurie Daffe, Vincent Kaufmann (Lasur, EPFL), Claudia R. Binder and Livia Fritz (HERUS, EPFL), Ulli Vilsmaier (HERUS, EPFL and Leuphana University), Daniel Gatica-Perez (L’IDIAP, EPFL), Marie Santiago Delefosse (UNIL)
