# CERN establishes a COVID-19 task force

<p align="center"><a href="https://cern.ch/against-covid-19"><img src="/assets/images/images_posts/logo_cern.jpg"  width="40%"></a></p>

CERN establishes a task force to identify and support contributions from the Organization to combatting COVID-19 pandemic. [More info about the taskforce here](https://home.cern/news/news/cern/cern-establishes-task-force-contribute-global-fight-against-covid-19), the CERN against COVID-19 task force has already received hundreds of messages suggesting ideas ranging from producing sanitizer gel to designing and building sophisticated medical equipment.


In particular, a novel streamlined ventilator, called HEV, is being prototyped at CERN. Led by a team of physicists and engineers from the LHCb Experiment at CERN, HEV is supported by several CERN services. [More information about the ventilator](http://lnkd.in/gC9jWPG)

The aim is to release CERN developments against COVID-19 under the CERN Open Hardware Licence so that equipment may be produced wherever there is a need, and adapted to local regulatory frameworks.

As these projects mature, details will be made available at [cern.ch/against-covid-19](cern.ch/against-covid-19).
