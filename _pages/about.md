# Taskforce Objectives

* To support efforts by public health authorities, medical services and governments to defeat COVID-19 by solving issues identified by them that we can address, ideally rapidly, using the skills and resources of our partner laboratories and research teams.

* To catalogue partner laboratories and research teams who wish to volunteer their efforts, and assist in the coordination of that work.

* To catalogue public authorities who have asked for support, and establish means by which their issues can be identified, clarified and resolved by partners.

* To coordinate with other such initiatives by the AI and technology research and commercial sector, and to disseminate collaboration opportunities created by them.

* To catalogue and disseminate issues that have been successfully addressed, by partner laboratories or others.
